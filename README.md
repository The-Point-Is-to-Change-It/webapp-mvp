# The Point Is to Change It
A productivity tool for nonprofits, social and professional clubs, advocacy groups, and anything else that doesn't adhere to a traditional management structure. The default team structure doesn't work for you? That's ok. You can change it. In fact, The Point Is to Change It.

## Notes about this repository
This repository is a legacy version of The Point Is to Change It, which is no longer under development. I began this project as a student unfamiliar with development process best practices, and aquired a significant amount of 'tech debt', rendering it more productive to restart from stratch with a team. I now focus most of my time on founding [Makers Club Tulsa](https://github.com/Holberton-Makers-Club), where I lead a team of 11 other student engineers in weekly development sprints.

## Overview of The Point Is to Change It
Imagine online communities centered around collective productivity. Instead of creating a subreddit or facebook group to simply share information, folks could create self-managing communities with tangible goals, vote on decisions, and establish always-accountable, always-recallable leadership structures. The Point Is to Change It will allow users to create democratic teams, individually manage the authorities they grant to teams as easily as app permissions on their phone, and scale up by joining teams of teams. It has a wide range of uses, from planning a vacation with your friends to building mass movements. It's about creating online communities that are flexible, bottom-up, accountable, and scalable. Here, the point isn't to get together and talk about the world. <b>The Point Is to Change It.</b>

## Progress and Restart
This project will begin again nearly from scratch. Rather than the waterfall approach of designing wireframes for an entire MVP and then attempting to build it out, I'll use a more precise and agile strategy. I was able to build the authentication system, which had multiple tiers of access. Users could visit public pages such as the landing page, as well as semi-public pages such as the 'public square', where they could view information but could not use functionality without signing in. Then of course there were the fully private pages such as a user account, notifications, and an internal view of collective dashboards. In the future, I will develop more limited user stories and seek to work on single use cases at a time. I'll also focus more heavily on producing readable code, accessing information through the API as much as possible, and writing documentation for things that have to be accessed by multiple components, such as API endpoint I/O.
